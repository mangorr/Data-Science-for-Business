Please look for the file DSBA_2021_HW_01.pdf posted under the content section. The stock data you will need for this assignment has also been uploaded to the content section of Brightspace.

Note that the deadline is ~10 days from now but I recommend that you make a serious attempt at the data loading/merging tasks before our next class. During class next week, we will review some of the tasks from assignment 0 and discuss pandas data merging. This review  will help you with assignment 1 but you will benefit more from this discussion if you have made an effort at doing the work yourself.
